# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Start the program
### Step 2: 
Create variables for the values of the coordinates
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the output rounded off to two decimal places
### Step 5: 
Stop the program
### PROGRAM:
```

a=[10,6]
b=[4,2]
d=(((b[0]-a[0])**2)+((b[1]-a[1])**2))**0.5
print(round(d,2))
```
